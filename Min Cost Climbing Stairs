Given an array of integers cost[] where cost[i] is the cost of the ith step on a staircase. Once the cost is paid, you can either climb one or two steps. Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.
Assume 0-based Indexing. You can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.

Examples:

Input: cost[] = [10, 15, 20]
Output: 15
Explanation: Cheapest option is to start at cost[1], pay that cost, and go to the top.



Input: cost[] = [1, 100, 1, 1, 1, 100, 1, 1, 100, 1]
Output: 6
Explanation: Cheapest option is to start on cost[0], and only step on 1s, skipping cost[3].


Constraints:
2 ≤ cost.size() ≤ 105
0 ≤ cost[i] ≤ 999



class Solution {
    static int minCostClimbingStairs(int[] cost) {
        int next1 = 0, next2 = 0;

        for (int i = cost.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int curr = cost[i] + Math.min(next1, next2);
            next2 = next1;
            next1 = curr;
        }

        return Math.min(next1, next2);
    }
